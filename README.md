# AI-Millionaire-Image-Recognition-Challenge

“AI Millionaire – Image Recognition Challenge” was held on 19 Aug 2020 by Hong Kong Science Park. More than 80 AI-related companies and hundreds of visitors joined this event. It was a challenge to build a model for facial recognition. Candidates had to answer several questions such as matching celebrities' faces, determining gender, detecting computer-generated (GAN-generated) human faces, etc. Candidates with the best performance of accuracy and speed in finding the correct answers would be the winner. Please refer to the Game Rules.pdf for details.

In our model, we adopted MTCNN to extract human faces in photos and adopted InceptionResnet to extract face features.
